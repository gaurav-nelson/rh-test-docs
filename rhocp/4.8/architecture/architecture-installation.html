<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OpenShift Container Platform installation program offers you flexibility. You can use the installation program to deploy a cluster on infrastructure that the installation program provisions and the cluster maintains or deploy a cluster on infrastructure that you prepare and maintain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These two basic types of OpenShift Container Platform clusters are frequently called installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters and user-provisioned infrastructure clusters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both types of clusters have the following characteristics:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Highly available infrastructure with no single points of failure is available by default</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrators maintain control over what updates are applied and when</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You use the same installation program to deploy both types of clusters. The main assets generated by the installation program are the Ignition config files for the bootstrap, master, and worker machines. With these three configurations and correctly configured infrastructure, you can start an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OpenShift Container Platform installation program uses a set of targets and dependencies to manage cluster installation. The installation program has a set of targets that it must achieve, and each target has a set of dependencies. Because each target is only concerned with its own dependencies, the installation program can act to achieve multiple targets in parallel. The ultimate target is a running cluster. By meeting dependencies instead of running commands, the installation program is able to recognize and use existing components instead of running the commands to create them again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following diagram shows a subset of the installation targets and dependencies:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../_images/targets-and-dependencies.png" alt="OpenShift Container Platform installation targets and dependencies">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. OpenShift Container Platform installation targets and dependencies</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After installation, each cluster machine uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as the operating system. RHCOS is the immutable container host version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and features a RHEL kernel with SELinux enabled by default. It includes the <code>kubelet</code>, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every control plane machine in an OpenShift Container Platform 4.8 cluster must use RHCOS, which includes a critical first-boot provisioning tool called Ignition. This tool enables the cluster to configure the machines. Operating system updates are delivered as an Atomic OSTree repository that is embedded in a container image that is rolled out across the cluster by an Operator. Actual operating system changes are made in-place on each machine as an atomic operation by using rpm-ostree. Together, these technologies enable OpenShift Container Platform to manage the operating system like it manages any other application on the cluster, via in-place upgrades that keep the entire platform up-to-date. These in-place updates can reduce the burden on operations teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you use RHCOS as the operating system for all cluster machines, the cluster manages all aspects of its components and machines, including the operating system. Because of this, only the installation program and the Machine Config Operator can change machines. The installation program uses Ignition config files to set the exact state of each machine, and the Machine Config Operator completes more changes to the machines, such as the application of new certificates or keys, after installation.</p>

<p>In OpenShift Container Platform 4.8, the installation program is a Go binary file that performs a series of file transformations on a set of assets. The way you interact with the installation program differs depending on your installation type.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For clusters with installer-provisioned infrastructure, you delegate the infrastructure bootstrapping and provisioning to the installation program instead of doing it yourself. The installation program creates all of the networking, machines, and operating systems that are required to support the cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you provision and manage the infrastructure for your cluster, you must provide all of the cluster infrastructure and resources, including the bootstrap machine, networking, load balancing, storage, and individual cluster machines.</p>

<p>The default installation type uses installer-provisioned infrastructure. By default, the installation program acts as an installation wizard, prompting you for values that it cannot determine on its own and providing reasonable default values for the remaining parameters. You can also customize the installation process to support advanced infrastructure scenarios. The installation program provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can install either a standard cluster or a customized cluster. With a standard cluster, you provide minimum details that are required to install the cluster. With a customized cluster, you can specify more details about the platform, such as the number of machines that the control plane uses, the type of virtual machine that the cluster deploys, or the CIDR range for the Kubernetes service network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If possible, use this feature to avoid having to provision and maintain the cluster infrastructure. In all other environments, you use the installation program to generate the assets that you require to provision your cluster infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, OpenShift Container Platform manages all aspects of the cluster, including the operating system itself. Each machine boots with a configuration that references resources hosted in the cluster that it joins. This configuration allows the cluster to manage itself as updates are applied.</p>

<h4 id="_installation_process_details" class="discrete">Installation process details</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because each machine in the cluster requires information about the cluster when it is provisioned, OpenShift Container Platform uses a temporary <em>bootstrap</em> machine during initial configuration to provide the required information to the permanent control plane. It boots by using an Ignition config file that describes how to create the cluster. The bootstrap machine creates the control plane machines (also known as the master machines) that make up the control plane. The control plane machines then create the compute machines, which are also known as worker machines. The following figure illustrates this process:</p>

<div class="title">Figure 2. Creating the bootstrap, master, and worker machines</div>

<p>After the cluster machines initialize, the bootstrap machine is destroyed. All clusters use the bootstrap process to initialize the cluster, but if you provision the infrastructure for your cluster, you must complete many of the steps manually.</p>

<p>The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending <code>node-bootstrapper</code> certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for <em>Recovering from expired control plane certificates</em> for more information.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OpenShift Update Service (OSUS) provides over-the-air updates to OpenShift Container Platform, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS). It provides a graph, or diagram, that contains the <em>vertices</em> of component Operators and the <em>edges</em> that connect them. The edges in the graph show which versions you can safely update to. The vertices are update payloads that specify the intended state of the managed cluster components.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) in your cluster checks with the OpenShift Update Service to see the valid updates and update paths based on current component versions and information in the graph. When you request an update, the CVO uses the release image for that update to upgrade your cluster. The release artifacts are hosted in Quay as container images.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To allow the OpenShift Update Service to provide only compatible updates, a release verification pipeline drives automation. Each release artifact is verified for compatibility with supported cloud platforms and system architectures, as well as other component packages. After the pipeline confirms the suitability of a release, the OpenShift Update Service notifies you that it is available.</p>

The second controller polls the OpenShift Update Service to determine if updates are available.</p>

<p>During the upgrade process, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) applies the new configuration to your cluster machines. The MCO cordons the number of nodes as specified by the <code>maxUnavailable</code> field on the machine configuration pool and marks them as unavailable. By default, this value is set to <code>1</code>. The MCO then applies the new configuration and reboots the machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machines as workers, the MCO does not update the kubelet because you must update the OpenShift API on the machines first.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the specification for the new version applied to the old kubelet, the RHEL machine cannot return to the <code>Ready</code> state. You cannot complete the update until the machines are available. However, the maximum number of unavailable nodes is set to ensure that normal cluster operations can continue with that number of machines out of service.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>management state</em> of an Operator determines whether an Operator is actively
managing the resources for its related component in the cluster as designed. If
an Operator is set to an <em>unmanaged</em> state, it does not respond to changes in
configuration nor does it receive updates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While this can be helpful in non-production clusters or during debugging,
Operators in an unmanaged state are unsupported and the cluster administrator
assumes full control of the individual component configurations and upgrades.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An Operator can be set to an unmanaged state using the following methods:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Individual Operator configuration</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Individual Operators have a <code>managementState</code> parameter in their configuration.
This can be accessed in different ways, depending on the Operator. For example,
the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator accomplishes this by modifying a custom resource
(CR) that it manages, while the Cluster Samples Operator uses a cluster-wide
configuration resource.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Changing the <code>managementState</code> parameter to <code>Unmanaged</code> means that the Operator
is not actively managing its resources and will take no action related to the
related component. Some Operators might not support this management state as it
might damage the cluster and require manual recovery.</p>
